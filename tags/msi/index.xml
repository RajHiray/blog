      <description>With any key/password store I always thought that the weak link was the credentials used to access it. If that single point of failure was compromised then all your secrets would be vulnerable. Microsoft have overcome this by creating the Managed Identity. A Managed Identity is generated by a resource within Azure and can be configured to access resources that use Azure AD for authentication.
Managed Identity Managed identities for Azure resources is a feature of the Azure Active Directory.</description>

As developers we all understand and care about keeping dev and production secrets safe but managing those secrets on your own or especially in a team can be cumbersome.
Safeguarding Secrets In software Development Most of us know it’s a best practice to keep secret settings like connection strings, domain passwords, or other credentials as a runtime configuration and outside the source code.</description>
