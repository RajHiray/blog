## Why Contribute to Open Source? ## 

Contributing to `open-source projects` gives you an opportunity to volunteer your time to improve a project used by you and your community.
This is probably one of the coolest aspects of programming.

Why do people contribute to open source? Plenty of reasons!
 - Improve a project used by you 
 - It’s empowering to be able to make changes, even small ones
 - You can learn a lot from the source code.
 - Meet people who are interested in similar things
 - Your own code could be used globally.
 - Find mentors and teach others.

## How to Contribute to Open Source ##

If you’re a new open source contributor, It may difficult to start by thinking.
How do you find the right project? What if something goes wrong? What if you don’t know how to code?

Contributing to open source development sounds scarier than it really is.
There are plenty of projects on GitHub which encourage first time contributors and newbies to take action by labeling issues as `Good first issue`, `Beginner friendly` or `Help wanted`.

It doesn't have to be a code contribution, either - you can also help out by creating a pull request to update the documentation, fix typos that you find, or by doing a thorough code review.

You might scan a README and find a broken link or a typo. Or you’re a new user and you noticed something is broken, or an issue that you think should really be in the documentation. Instead of ignoring it and moving on, or asking someone else to fix it, see whether you can help out by pitching in. That’s what open source is all about!

> 28% of casual contributions to open source are documentation, such as a typo fix, reformatting, or writing a translation.

## Finding a Project to Contribute to ##

Now that you’ve figured out how open source projects work, it’s time to find a project to contribute to!

If you’re looking for existing issues you can fix, every open source project has a /contribute page that highlights beginner-friendly issues you can start out with. Navigate to the main page of the repository on GitHub, and add /contribute at the end of the URL (for example https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/contribute ).

You can also use one of the following resources to help you discover and contribute to new projects:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/explore/" target="_blank">GitHub Explore</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://opensourcefriday.com" target="_blank">Open Source Friday</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://www.codetriage.com/" target="_blank">CodeTriage</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://24pullrequests.com/" target="_blank">24 Pull Requests</a></li>

</ul>

## Wrapping Up ##
I hope you understand the importance of open source software and that you value its benefits. No matter what your reasons are for giving back to the open source community, just know that you are highly appreciated!

Many projects can only thrive with support and contributions from developers like you.
