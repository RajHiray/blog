      <description>With any key/password store I always thought that the weak link was the credentials used to access it. If that single point of failure was compromised then all your secrets would be vulnerable. Microsoft have overcome this by creating the Managed Identity. A Managed Identity is generated by a resource within Azure and can be configured to access resources that use Azure AD for authentication.
Managed Identity Managed identities for Azure resources is a feature of the Azure Active Directory.</description>

      <description>You’ve probably heard some version of the story about a developer who mistakenly checked in his key/secrete to source code.
As developers we all understand and care about keeping dev and production secrets safe but managing those secrets on your own or especially in a team can be cumbersome.
Safeguarding Secrets In software Development Most of us know it’s a best practice to keep secret settings like connection strings, domain passwords, or other credentials as a runtime configuration and outside the source code.</description>

      <description>How do you treat files you don’t want to include in your commit?
Write it in .gitignore, isn’t it?
How you treat files you want to ignore in every git repository? always put file name in .gitignore?
For example you are using Visual Studio 2019 IDE, VS19 will create .vs folder in your project folder. you always ignore these files in every single project you’re working on by configuring in project level or repository level .</description>
